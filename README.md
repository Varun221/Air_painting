# Air_painting
An OpenCV Project

Ever wished drawing in air and the paint to come live?
Well here's your wish fulfilled

Features - 
1. Select your favourite colour and brush size, without ever touching the keyboard.
2. Save your file, when done painting, again, without ever touching the keyboard.
3. Stop painting when you want by "holding" the camera by showing your hand. (how cool is that!?)

Customizing - 
To create your own marker, find the hsv values. ( The files hsv.py and hsv_check.py are there to help)
and load them in lower_bound and upper_bound
To create the holder, follow the same as above and load them into hold_up and hold_down.
